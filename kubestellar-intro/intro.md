# Welcome to KubeStellar!

KubeStellar simplifies multi-cluster Kubernetes configuration management. 
Instead of managing each cluster individually, you define workloads once and 
use binding policies to deploy them across multiple clusters.

## What You'll Learn:
- How to set up KubeStellar with KubeFlex
- How to create and register workload execution clusters
- How to deploy workloads across multiple clusters using BindingPolicies
- How KubeStellar works with kubectl, Helm, and ArgoCD

## Prerequisites:
This environment comes with:
- Kubernetes cluster (2 nodes)
- kubectl
- Docker
- curl

We'll install KubeStellar components during the tutorial.

Let's get started!
