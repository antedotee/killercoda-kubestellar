# 🎉 Congratulations!

You've successfully completed the KubeStellar demo! Here's what you accomplished:

## What You Learned:

1. **KubeStellar Setup**: Installed KubeFlex and KubeStellar core components
2. **Multi-Cluster Management**: Registered multiple clusters with OCM
3. **Binding Policies**: Created policies to define workload-to-cluster mappings
4. **Multi-Cluster Deployment**: Deployed workloads across multiple clusters with a single command

## Key Takeaways:

- **KubeStellar simplifies multi-cluster operations** - Deploy once, run everywhere
- **Works with standard Kubernetes tools** - No need to learn new APIs
- **Label-based selection** - Use familiar Kubernetes label selectors

## Next Steps:

- Explore [KubeStellar Documentation](https://kubestellar.io)
- Try deploying with Helm: `helm install` in WDS
- Experiment with different binding policies

Thank you for trying KubeStellar!
